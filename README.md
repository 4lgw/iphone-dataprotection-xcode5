iPhone Data Protection Tools cloned from https://code.google.com/p/iphone-dataprotection on January 24, 2015.

Code ("build_tools.sh") slightly changed back for OS X Yosemite (v 10.10.x) with Xcode 5.1.1 (iOS 7.1):
- "build_tools.sh‚Äù: SDK references point to 10.9

Xcode still uses the references to OS 10.9 instead of 10.10 (Yosemite).
